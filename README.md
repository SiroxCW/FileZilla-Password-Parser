## FileZilla-Password-Parser
This is a old, <i>especially bad</i> script I wrote when I started to learn python.<br/>
This script prints the locally saved FileZilla passwords by reading the filezilla.xml file and just decoding the base64.

<i>(please dont look at the horrible code...)</i>

## Usage
run ```python main.py```
